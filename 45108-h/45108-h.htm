<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop_m.jpg" width="32" height="35" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">MY dear children, unless you have been fortunate
enough to be taken to the menagerie by some
grown-up friend, somebody who would patiently answer
all your questions, and tell you all about the bewitchingly
horrible animals in the cages, and into whose arms you
might run when they growled and looked fierce, I do not
think you can know the joy of Tom, Trixie and Gay as
they entered the menagerie with Mr. Barnum.</div>

<div>
<img src="images/i_006a.jpg" alt="animals" width="258" height="284" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/i_006b.jpg" alt="animals" width="338" height="68" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/i_006c.jpg" alt="animals" width="600" height="296" class="splitr" />
</div>


<p>Trixie hugged his right arm tight, as usual, Gay kept
fast hold of his left hand, while Tom was so anxious to
miss no part of the show that he did not know that he
was walking so clumsily as to put Mr. Barnum's toes in
danger; and, notwithstanding they were such old chums,
I fancy he was more than once tempted to say to the boy,
"Tom, you are as awkward as a grizzly bear!"</p>

<div>
<img src="images/i_007a.jpg" alt="animals" width="275" height="144" class="split" />
<img src="images/i_007b.jpg" alt="animals" width="311" height="54" class="split" />

<img src="images/i_007d.jpg" alt="animals" width="550" height="318" class="split" />
</div>


<p>At the sight of the zebra, Gay laughed aloud. "He
is knitted all in stripes&mdash;he is made of garters!" she said;
and she thought the gnu looked like a wild bull "in front,"
but when he turned round she said he was a horse.</p>

<p>And oh! you should have heard the buffalo snort at
Gay! "He wants to make a meal of baby," said Tom,
but the truth was a man had been teasing him with a
cane, and when a buffalo is angry, he is not a very
pleasant play-fellow.</p>

<p>"I mean to hunt the buffalo, out West, when I
am a man," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Then you must hurry and grow up," said
Mr. Barnum, "for the animal, in our own
country, is being rapidly exterminated."</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of exterminated?"
asked Tom.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Killed off," said Mr. Barnum; and Tom thought that a much better way of saying it.</p>

<p>"Does a buffalo grow up out of a buffalo bug?" asked Gay. Then they all laughed at her till she
pouted, and Trixie thought, "I must remember to tell that to mama."</p>

<p>The reindeer, the antelope, and the moose were all somewhat alike&mdash;"cousins," the children called
them; and Gay had a very pretty name for two reindeer
that she thought especially beautiful&mdash;she said they
were "Santa Claus's ponies;" and I am sure that
even Santa Claus would have been delighted to
drive them.</p>

<p>Elephants! Just what Tom had been longing
for, and it was strange to see how frisky the great
clumsy creatures could be. They stood on one
another's backs, they tried to waltz, and then two
of them, after much floundering and capering,
jumped over a bar; but not even Mr. Barnum
himself could say they did it gracefully.</p>

<p>"See those two play see-saw!" cried Trixie,
laughing till her little sides shook, "and that
little fellow is grinding a hand-organ!"</p>

<p>Others, dressed like clowns, were as
full of tricks as so many monkeys.
The very largest elephant thrust his
trunk forward, and Tom whispered
to a boy who stood near,
"You pull his front tail, and
hear him roar!" But the
elephant rolled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a><br /><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a><br /><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
eyes toward Tom as if to say, "Better try it
yourself, young man," and Tom moved back.</p>

said he.</p>

<p>"Who was Jumbo?" asked Trixie.</p>

<p>"Oh, a tremendous elephant, as big as
six of these rolled into one! He went to
Canada, and there a locomotive smashed into
his brain, and he turned over and died. But
first he wrapped his trunk around the baby
elephant and flung him safe off the track."</p>


<p>"Good Jumbo!" said Gay with a smile;
but there were tears in Trixie's eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, baby; and that's the way we would
jump for you in any danger," added Tom.</p>

<p>Gay smiled sweetly again, but Trixie
squeezed her old friend's hand so hard that he
bent down and kissed her, saying, "But there <i>is</i> no
danger, Toodles!"</p></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The children were now quite ready to leave the
elephants to look at the ostriches and the storks.
I think that Trixie expected to see the ostriches
wholly covered with long, dangling feathers, such
as those she wore on her hat; and she was a little
disappointed. The storks were old friends of hers,
because mama had a screen at home, upon which storks
were embroidered; and some of these birds, like those on
the screen, were resting upon one foot.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="550" height="675" alt="birds: ostritch, penguin, flamingo, etc." />
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom was very much interested in the sea birds,&mdash;the albatross, the penguin, and the auk, but there
was such a crowd around their cage that he came
away grumbling.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Tom," said Mr. Barnum:
"come and see the fisherman that carries his
basket under his chin!"</p>

<p>Tom did not understand this joke at first,
but Mr. Barnum explained that he meant the
pelican, which has a pouch under its beak in which it
carries home the fish to feed its young.</p>


<p>"Look out, Trixie!" cried Tom, when they saw the
whale. "He swallowed a man once."</p>

<p>"Did this <i>very whale</i> swallow a man?" asked Trixie,
solemnly; "and did you <i>know</i> the man?"</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;not exactly; but I knew <i>of</i> him."</p>

<p>"What was his name?"</p>

<p>"Jonah."</p>

<p>"O, Tom Van Tassel! That was as much as fifty
years ago, and Jonah was a bible man. The whale
looks kind and I'm not afraid of him," and Trixie
went up very close. "But what makes him so
floppy? I should think the whalebones in him
would stiffen him."</p>

<p>And then Mr. Barnum explained that what
we call whalebone is something that grows in
the mouth of a whale, and is used as a strainer,
to separate the water from the food.</p>

<p>They thought the shark a mean-looking
creature, and they were
surprised to learn that it
turns on its back
to bite.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of fish&mdash;let us find something furious!" said Tom; so they started toward the lion's cage.
The great, grand king of them all was taking his afternoon rest, and he opened his eyes and looked at
them once, as if to say, "Behold and admire! I am the King of Beasts, and you are only little human
Yankees! I had these bars put up to keep off the crowd. Kings must be neither pushed nor hustled."
Then he waved his paw with a flourish which meant, "Begone!" and Mr. Barnum, seeing the roar coming,
said, "Come on, Toodles."</p>

<p>But Tom staid, and he was glad that he did so. The
keeper of the lions entered the cage, and the excitement
began. The poor beasts were all hungry, but the lioness
and the little cubs were fed first; and when King Lion
seemed ready to tear the bars down in his fury, the
keeper fired off a pistol, and the angry creature
leaped into the air. I think even his own little
baby cubs were afraid of him. When he grew
quieter, he, too, was fed, and Tom ran to tell
Trixie all about it.</p>

<p>"I am glad I did not stay," she said, "and I
have had a very good time, myself. I have
been looking at the giraffes in harness, and I do
think they make such funny looking horses.
They look very much like ostriches&mdash;<i>in the
neck</i>," she added, and Mr. Barnum laughed.</p>

<p>The giraffe is so tall that it can take its food
from high trees, and it very seldom stoops to
eat. But when a piece of sugar was put on the
ground, the temptation was so great that it bent
its head down between its fore feet, placed near
together, and gobbled with a half-glide. Oh,
how the people laughed at
its awkwardness.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would mama say if we ate like that, Trixie?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"You could'nt do it," said the boy who had refused to pull the elephants "front tail."</p>

<p>Far off, in one corner, the children saw something which they thought, at first, was a dog, but as they
came closer, it sat up like a monkey.</p>


<p>"That is a baboon," said Mr. Barnum. "It is so cross that I don't believe it has a friend in the world;
while the bright-looking baby ourang-outang there, is always sure of a petting. That gray old grandfather
ourang-outang, however, can be very ugly; but we must always be patient with old people," said
he, smiling.</p>

<p>The Happy Family, they all declared, was less exciting, but quite as interesting, as the lions' cage.
They had enjoyed seeing the monkeys alone, but a monkey isn't half a monkey until you see him with
other animals. Two solemn, old owls sat perched in one corner, and, when a monkey flung an orange
into the face of one of them, the other wouldn't even wink. A funny old gray fellow put his paw through
the bars and pulled off Tom's cap, and it was only by the offer
of a handful of nuts that the owner got it back.</p>

<p>Another took a guinea-pig in her lap, and rocked
it as if it were her baby; but the sly chance of pulling
a rabbit's ear was too much for mother monkey,
so she was off again, tossing a nut at a squirrel
as she passed.</p>

<p>White mice, little and pink-eyed,
nibbled and squeaked, while the friendly
cats lapped their milk close by; and
even the parrots seemed to love the
monkeys&mdash;a thing never heard of
before.</p>

<p>But how could they all fail to
be happy together, living as they
did, in a menagerie! Oh! how
the boys and girls envied them,
feeling that they would almost be
willing to give up quarreling with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a><br /><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
their dear brothers and sisters to enjoy
such a life!</p>

<p>"Trixie," cried Tom, when they had
wandered away from the Happy
Family, "come and see this queer big
pin-cushion!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, starting
back.</p>

<p>"A porcupine," said Tom, laughing
loudly. He had startled the strange
animal, which, fearing some danger
near, had rolled itself into a ball, and
thrust out the quills with which it protects
itself.</p>

<p>"Would you like to pet and smooth
it, Gay?" asked Mr. Barnum.</p>


<p>"No, no! I'd rather smooth that little
animal," said she, pointing to the chinchilla.
"It looks like a sister of my little muff."</p>

<p>"O, Gay! you are a funny baby," said Trixie,
laughing, and speaking as though she, herself, were
quite an elderly person.</p>

<p>"Do you want to see the kangaroo do the high
running jump?" Tom asked. But the kangaroo
refused to jump for them. Mr. Barnum then told
them how, like the opossum, the mother carries
her babies snugly tucked in her pocket.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen any bears yet," said Trixie.</p>

<p>"No, but you <i>shall</i> see them, Toodles," said
Mr. Barnum. "Who ever heard of a
menagerie without its bears? And
here they are!"</p>

<p>Up on their hind legs they stood,
waiting a minute till the music began,
and then, at the first note of the
fiddle, off they went&mdash;slowly at first,
then faster and faster, until really they
were almost graceful! Even the baby
bears danced! But a grey old grizzly sat gossiping
with a polar bear in a corner, while they too
watched the dancing, like old ladies at a ball.
Afterward, at a sign from the master, the same old
grizzly took the fiddle himself, and played for the
young people's dancing. Then the bears marched
up and down, singly and in pairs, "cooling off,"
Tom said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p>Trixie heard a lady say to her friend, "The <i>camels</i> are coming!" and then they both laughed, but
Trixie could not see why. Sure enough, the camels <i>were</i> coming, and racing camels are even more
awkward than dancing bears.</p>

<p>"Their backs are all broken," said Gay.</p>

<p>"No," said Tom, "they were born all humps and bumps&mdash;they are camels."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said Gay. "I know&mdash;mama has got a shawl made out of one."</p>

<p>"And," added Tom, "he can drink enough at one time to last him a hundred years."</p>

<p>"Don't stretch it, sir," said Mr. Barnum, shaking his head at the boy; but Tom went on&mdash;"and he
will carry you across the desert quicker than lightning!"</p>

<p>The snakes, and especially the boa-constrictor, made Gay shiver, and she refused to look at them
after the first glance. But the others enjoyed seeing them. "Nothing that is quiet frightens me,"
said Trixie, "and I love to see the snakes twist and wriggle."</p>

<p>"I like the big green frogs," said Gay&mdash;"Ker-chong! ker-chong!" She had learned the
whole frog language in an instant!</p>

<p>Then she straggled away with Tom, to listen to wonderful stories about the beaver,
and how he builds his curious log hut; "But," added
Tom, "his roof always leaks."</p>

<p>"Gay, here is an animal with a name longer than
you are yourself!" said Mr. Barnum.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, as they paused before a
creature with a tremendous mouth.</p>

<p>"The Hippopotamus."</p>

<p>"Hip-po-pot-a-mus!" baby tried to say after him,
adding, "he is not pretty, and I do not like him."</p>

<p>Tom was still less polite, and called the animal
"beastly ugly;" though he seemed to admire the one-horned
rhinoceros, which Gay thought still more frightful.
"But how wallopy his skin is!" said Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Barnum, "but he has a thinner skin
under his heavy hide, which is only what Trixie would
call his 'upper skirt'&mdash;eh, Toodles?" and the little girl
laughed to think that he should know anything about
such drapery.</p>

<p>When she saw the alligator she wished for his scaly
skin, that she might have it made into slippers for
papa.</p>


<p>But what had become of Gay? She had left the
others, and they found her trying to stroke a downy
little yellow chicken, which was just beyond her
reach.</p>

<p>"Why this is like being in the country!" cried the
delighted Trixie, looking around at the horses and the
cattle, the pigs and the chickens. "Where's Tom?"</p>

<p>But a barn-yard scene was quite too tame for that
young gentleman, who was chattering away to a funny
little squat Esquimau, who did not understand a word
he said. Near him were a fat seal and a walrus with
two great tusks which seemed to say, "The better to
eat you, my dear!"</p>

<p>The Esquimau and his pets had come from a faraway,
cold country, where there were very few people,
and I do not think they liked the crowd and the
noise.</p>

<p>"Where are the tigers?" Tom asked, suddenly remembering
that he had set his heart on being half-scared
to death by the glance from a tiger's eye.</p>

<p>"They certainly would never forgive us if we forgot to present ourselves," said Mr. Barnum, bowing
low before a cage, against the bars of which the Royal Bengal Tiger was rubbing his glossy sides, as he
marched angrily backward and forward.</p>

<p>"Come away!" cried Trixie, trying to clasp her three friends in her tiny arms.</p>

<p>"You go, Toodles, if you are afraid," said Mr. Barnum.</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried, "I will not go without you!" and she became still more frightened when she
saw a beautiful, fierce-eyed leopard, and a hyena whose horrible grin showed three rows of teeth.</p>

<p>"The little goose!" said Tom. "See! Gay enjoys it all." And so she did, afterward going with
him to look at the wolves, the wildcats,
and the dainty little red foxes,
while Mr. Barnum took his pet to see
the brilliant birds which had been
brought from their own homes in the
hot countries to our town of the little
brown sparrow.</p>

<p>Great green parrots, gold and silver
pheasants, white cockatoos, and the
flaming red flamingo! Trixie was wild
with joy, but, oh! she could not half
enjoy them without
Gay and Tom; so she
scampered off after
them, not noticing in
her joy that she passed
once again very near
the tiger's cage.</p>

<p>The little Bird of Paradise,
with its long train of
plumage which showed all
the colors of the rainbow,
was more beautiful than
anything they had ever
imagined. "Let us stay
here all the rest of the day!"
Gay said.</p>



<p>"All the rest of the day,
darling!" repeated Mr. Barnum,
looking at his watch,
"Why it is almost time for
my own birds to be in their
nest."</p>

<p>Yes, the sun was fast
sinking in the west, and the
time had come for tired
little feet to turn toward
home. Mama was watching
for them at the parlor
window, and she lifted baby
in her arms as she opened
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, mama! I want my supper, and I
want to go to bed!"</p>



<p>But in the middle of the night she awoke
with a laugh, crying&mdash;"Oh, how funny! I
dreamed that the little Chinese dwarf was
waltzing with the giraffe!"</p>

<p>"Hush, darling!" said Trixie, softly,
sitting up in her little crib. "You'll wake
mama, baby!"</p>
